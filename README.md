## About
A simple RPG prototype for the LÖVE framework, created as proof-of-concept.  
  
Currently a work in progress.



## How to Play
Use the arrow keys to explore the world around you. Interact with NPCs and the surrounding environment by pressing the spacebar.



## Installation & Runtime
### Linux (Mac too I guess)
- Install [LÖVE](https://www.love2d.org)
- Clone the repo and `cd` into it
- Run `love .`
### Windows
- Install [LÖVE](https://www.love2d.org)
- Apparently you can just drop the repo onto the `love.exe` executable which is pretty neat
